This is a flask application with CRUD functionality for admin.
In this application we have used Python (flask), Cloudinary and Postgres(Prod) (via SQLAlchemy) as a backend and for frontend we have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 and JS.
I have also include a basic modular structure of Flask which include static folder, template folder, requirements.txt and app.py (main_app).

Also, in the end we have used pytest for test cases.

## Main Features
- Admin can create, update and delete post.
- One can contact admin.
- Admin can upload images on cloudinary.
